## Description

**Turn Bluetooth proximity into powerful automations.**

MagicCuts bridges your Bluetooth devices with Apple Shortcuts and Siri, enabling location-aware automations that just work—no hubs, no subscriptions, no cloud required.

**How It Works:**
1. Scan for nearby Bluetooth devices
2. Save devices you want to monitor with custom signal strength thresholds
3. Use Shortcuts or Siri to check if a device is nearby
4. Build powerful automations that respond to device proximity

**Perfect For:**
• Smart home automations triggered by device presence
• "Is my bag nearby?" checks before leaving
• Automated scenes when you approach your desk
• Finding if Bluetooth accessories are in range
• Context-aware shortcuts that adapt to your environment

**Key Features:**
• Works entirely in the background—no app launching required
• Configurable RSSI thresholds for precise "nearby" detection
• Native Siri integration: "Hey Siri, is my headphones device nearby?"
• Full Shortcuts app support for complex automations
• Real-time signal strength testing while configuring
• Privacy-first: all data stays on your device

**Voice Commands:**
• "Is my [Device Name] nearby?"
• "Check for my [Device Name]"

**Technical Details:**
• Uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for efficient scanning
• Adjustable signal strength thresholds (-30 to -100 RSSI)
• 10-second scan windows for reliable detection
• Works with any discoverable Bluetooth device

**Privacy Focused:**
MagicCuts stores all device data locally on your iPhone. No accounts, no cloud sync, no data collection. Your Bluetooth devices and automation patterns stay completely private.
